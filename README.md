Our revolutionary online food ordering system simplifies browsing and ordering from local restaurants.From the case study of online food ordering systems, we can identify the main contributor which is supply management. Here all the goods we need are procured from the suppliers under conditions suitable for the business. On receipt of goods from suppliers, product name, date, quantity, price, supplier description, quality check etc. are entered into the system. In this supply management, you can retrieve the entered information and update it whenever necessary. The administrator has the ability to delete information from the system in problematic situations such as outdated information or returned goods.
In addition, the monthly report containing the details of the goods is issued.
